# Classify-Leaves
This is the implementation of the kaggle competition named Classify Leaves.
As you see, this repo is created after I study the online course DIVE INTO DEEP LEARNING taught by Teacher Mu Li at https://space.bilibili.com/1567748478/channel/seriesdetail?sid=358497.
I decided to create it as my first repo in the long run of the process of studying deep learning now and in the future.At first, I faced with a couple of difficulties which are caused by my incomplete understanding of the use of Pytorch API.I was definitely a bit of frustrated when they occurred.But I dealt with them under my enough patience by searching for a few materials.
In general, I am really happy to complete this competition and receive a nice grade as I think.The tricks in this repo are refered to https://www.kaggle.com/code/zachary666/classify-leaf.Last but not least, I create this repo for the purpose of recording the process of studying deep learning by myself and motivating myself as it is my first repo.
